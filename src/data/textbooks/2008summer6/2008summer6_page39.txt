The Federal Judicial Center, established by Congress in 1967, is the
research and education agency of the federal judicial system. The Center’s
duties include conducting and promoting orientation and continuing
education and training for federal judges, court employees, and others;
developing recommendations about the operation and study of the federal
courts; and conducting and promoting research on federal judicial
procedures, court operations, and history. By statute, the Chief Justice of
The Supreme Court of the United States chairs the Center’s Board, which
also includes the director of the Administrative Office of the United States
Courts and seven judges elected by the Judicial Conference of the United
States. The Board appoints the Center’s director and deputy director and in
turn the director appoints the Center’s staff.
