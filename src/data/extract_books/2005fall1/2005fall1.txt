United States Courts of
Appeals

Internet: app.comm.uscourts. gov/appeals.htm.

The intermediate appellate courts in the federal judicial system are the
courts of appeals. Twelve of these courts have jurisdiction over cases from
certain geographic areas: The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has
national jurisdiction over specific types of cases. A disappointed party in a
district court usually has the right to have the case reviewed in the court of
appeats for the circuit. Appeals court judges are appointed for life by the
President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Each court of appeals
consists of six or more judges, depending on the caseload of the court. The
judge who has served on the court the longest and who is under 65 years
of age is designated as the chief judge and performs administrative duties
in addition to hearing cases. 4
