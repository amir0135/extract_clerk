There are 94 courts in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the territories of Guam, the United States Virgin, Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands. With the exception of the territorial courts, all district court judges are appointed for life by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. In each district, the judge who has served on the court the longest and who is under 65 years of age is designated as the chief judge. The chief judge has administrative duties in. addition fo a caseload. Within each district, the United States Bankruptcy Court hears and decides petitions of individuals and businesses seeking relief from bankruptcy. Bankruptcy judges are appointed by the court of appeals for a term of 14 years, The judges of each district appoint one or more magistrate judges, who discharge many of the ancillary duties of the district judges, There are both full-time and part-time magistrate judge positions, and these positions are assigned to the district courts according te caseload criteria. A full-time magistrate judge serves a term of eight years; a part-time magistrate judge’s term is four years. United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama Frank M.
