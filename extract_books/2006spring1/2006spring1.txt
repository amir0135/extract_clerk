courts in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico, and the territories of Guam, the United States Virgin, Islands,
and the Northern Mariana Islands. With the exception of the territorial
courts, all district court judges are appointed for life by the President with
the advice and consent of the Senate. In each district, the judge who has
served on the court the longest and who is under 65 years of age is
designated as the chief judge. The chief judge has administrative duties in.
