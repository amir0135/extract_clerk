expeditious conduct of court business, the reviewing of circuit council

operation and effect of general rules of practice and procedure in use
within the federal courts. In addition, the Judicial Conference supervises

a variety of subjects dealing with administration of the courts. The Chief
Justice of the United States is the presiding officer of the conference.
Membership is comprised of the chief judges of each judicial circuit, the

judge representatives are elected for terms of not less than three nor more
than five successive years, as established by majority vote of all circuit and
district judges of their circuit. Terms on the conference of elected members
