88 United States District Courts

United States District Courts

Most federal cases are initially tried and decided in the United States
District Courts, the federal courts of general trial jurisdiction. There are 94
courts in the 50 states, the District of Colurbia, the Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico, and the territories of Guam, the United States Virgin Islands,
and the Northern Mariana Islands. With the exception of the territorial
courts, all district court judges are appointed for life by the President with
the advice and consent of the Senate. In each district, the judge who has
served on the court the longest and who is under 65 years of age is
designated as the chief judge. The chief judge has administrative duties in
addition to a caseload. Within each district, the United States Bankruptcy
Court heats and decides petitions of individuals and businesses seeking
relief from bankruptcy. Bankruptcy judges are appointed by the court of
appeals for a term of 14 years. The judges of each district appoint one or
more magistrate judges, who discharge many of the ancillary duties of the
district judges. There are both full-time and part-time magistrate judge
positions, and these positions are assigned to the district courts according
to caseload criteria, A full-time magistrate judge serves a term of eight
years; a part-time magistrate judge’s term is four years.
