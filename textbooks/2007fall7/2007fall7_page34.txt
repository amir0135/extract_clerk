Created by an Act of Congress in 1939, the Administrative Office of the
United States Courts provides management and program support and
administrative services to the federal courts. It implements the policies of
the Judicial Conference of the United States and provides staff support and
legal counsel to the Judicial Conference’s committees. The services
provided by the Administrative Office include program, legal and
administrative assistance to Article IN, bankruptcy and magistrate judges
and court employees. It also handles coordination between and among

the judicial branch, the legislative branch, the executive branch and

state courts. The Administrative Office is responsible for collecting and
reporting judiciary statistics and supports program activity in the areas of
court administration, defender services, and probation and pretrial services.
Appointment of the Administrative Office Director is made by the Chief
Justice of the United States, in consultation with the Judicial Conference
of the United States.
