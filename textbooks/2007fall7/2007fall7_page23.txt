dishonorable discharge or bad conduct discharge certified by the service’s
Judge Advocate General or the General Counsel of the Department of
Transportation acting for the Coast Guard. The court’s jurisdiction is
worldwide. Appeals to this court come in response to court-martials in the
Army, Navy-Marine Corps, Air Force and Coast Guard Courts of Criminal
Appeals. Rulings can be appealed to the Supreme Court of the United
States for review. The Washington, DC-based court is exclusively an
appellate criminal court consisting of five civilian judges appointed to
15-year terms by the President with Senate confirmation.
