The Judicial Conference of the United States is the principal policy
making body concerned with the administration of the United States
Courts. The specific duties of the Judicial Conference include surveying
the conditions of business in the courts of the United States, preparing
plans for the assignment of judges to or from courts of appeals or district
courts, promoting uniformity of management procedures and the
expeditious conduct of court business, the reviewing of circuit council
conduct and disability orders, and carrying on a continuous study of the
operation and effect of general rules of practice and procedure in use
within the federal courts. In addition, the Judicial Conference supervises
the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts and
operates through a network of committees created to address and advise on
a variety of subjects dealing with administration of the courts. The Chief
Justice of the United States is the presiding officer of the conference.
Membership is comprised of the chief judges of each judicial circuit, the
chief judge of the Court of International Trade, and a district judge

from each regional judicial circuit. A circuit chief judge’s term on the
conference is concurrent with his or her term as chief Judge of the circuit,
seven years or until seventy years of age, whichever comes first. District
judge representatives are elected for terms of not less than three nor more
than five successive years, as established by majority vote of all circuit and
district judges of their circuit. Terms on the conference of elected members
are effective and expire on October 1 of any given year. The Director of
the Administrative Office of the United States Courts serves as the Judicial
Conference Secretary.
