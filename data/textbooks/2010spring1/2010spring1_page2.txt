United States Courts of
Appeals

The intermediate appellate courts in the federal judicial system are the
courts of appeals. Twelve of these courts have jurisdiction over cases from
certain geographic areas. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has
national jurisdiction over specific types of cases. A disappointed party in a
district court usually has the right to have the case reviewed in the court of
appeals for the circuit. Appeals court judges are appointed for life by the
President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Each court of appeals
consists of six or more judges, depending on the caseload of the court. The
judge who has served on the court the longest and who is under 65 years
of age is designated as the chief judge and performs administrative duties
in addition to hearing cases.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit handles cases
by subject matter without regard to the region. The Court hears all appeals
for the United States Court of Federal Claims, the United States Court of
International Trade and the United States Court of Veterans Appeals. The
Federal Circuit hears appeals from United States District Courts in patent
cases, cases involving energy regulation and economic stabilization as well
as appeals from a variety of adminisirative proceedings. Established in
1982, the Washington, DC-based Federal Circuit possesses national
jurisdiction as a result of the merger between the Appellate Division of the
former United States Court of Claims and the United States Court of
Customs and Patent Appeals.
