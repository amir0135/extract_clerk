Number of Judgeships: ?

The United States Court of International Trade is an Article TI court

with exclusive nationwide jurisdiction over civil actions against the

United States, its agencies and officers. Its jurisdiction also includes
certain civil actions brought by the United States, arising out of import
transactions and the administration and enforcement of the federal customs
and international trade laws. The Court reviews administrative decisions of
the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection involving the tariff laws of
the United States, including the classification and valuation of imported
merchandise. The Court hears judicial challenges to determinations

by the United States Department of Commerce and the United States
International Trade Commission pertaining to the antidumping and
countervailing duty laws. In addition, the Court reviews decisions by

the Secretary of Labor, Commerce or Agriculture certifying workers,
businesses or agricultural commodity procedures respectively eligible for
assistance due to economic injury caused by import competition. The
Court also possesses exclusive jurisdiction of actions brought by the
United States to: {1} recover civil penalties for fraud, gross negligence or
negligence in the entry of imported merchandise; (2) recover upon a bond
relating to the importation of merchandise; or (3) recover customs duties.
Judges are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. These
are Article III judgeships to which members are appointed for life, pending
good behavior. Cases are determined by a single judge. Cases raising a
constitutional issue or cases with broad significant implications may be
assigned by the chief judge to a three-judge panel: Appeals from the
Court of International Trade are heard by the United States Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Court is located in New York City,
but sessions may be held anywhere within the United States. The Court is
also authorized to hold hearings in foreign countries.
