nited States District Courts

ast federal cases are initially tried and decided in the United States
‘¢rict Courts, the federal courts of general trial jurisdiction. There are 94
ns in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of
- Rico, and the territories of Guar, the United States Virgin Islands,
“gad the Northern Mariana Islands. With the exception of the territorial
‘spurts, all district court judges are appointed for life by the President with
the advice and consent of the Senate. In each district, the judge who has
‘served OL the court the longest and who is under 65 years of age is
designated as the chief judge. The chief judge has administrative duties in
“bd dition to a caseload. Within each district, the United States Bankruptey
“Court hears and decides petitions of individuals and businesses seeking
‘yelief from bankruptcy. Bankruptcy judges are appointed by the court of
‘appeals for a tert of 14 years. The judges of each district appoint one or
more magistrate judges, who discharge many of the ancillary duties of the
district judges. There are both full-time and part-time magistrate judge
positions, and these positions are assigned to the district courts according
to caseload criteria. A full-time magistrate judge serves a term of eight
years, 4 part-time magistrate judge’s term is four years.
