consent, for 15-year terms. The chief judge is selected by the President to
serve until the age of seventy or until another chief judge is chosen.
Retirees may serve as senior judges on assigned cases.

United States Tax Court

Internet: www.ustaxcourt.goy

Number of Judgeships: 19

The United States Tax Court hears disputes involving the Internal Revenue
Service and deficiencies or overpayment of taxes. This court also has
jurisdiction to redetermine excise taxes and penalties imposed on private
foundations. Similar power over excise taxes is conferred to the court

with regard to public charities, qualified pension plans and real estate
investment trusts. The United States Tax Court judges are appointed by the
‘esident and confirmed by the Senate to 15-year terms. A chief judge is
elected biennially by fellow judges. Both recalled and special trial judges
serve at the pleasure of the court. Public trials are conducted by a single
judge or a special trial judge. These rulings can be appealed to the United
States Courts of Appeals and the Supreme Court of the United States.
