Created under the provisions of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of
1984, the United States Sentencing Commission is an independent agency

as the related provisions of the Crime Control Act, went into effect on
November 1, 1987. The Commission is composed of seven members
appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The
Onited States Attorney General and the chair of the United States Parole
Commission also serve on the Sentencing Commission as non-voting,
ex-officio members.
