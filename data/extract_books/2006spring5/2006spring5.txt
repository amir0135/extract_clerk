Number of Judgeships: ?

The United States Court of International Trade is an Article TI court

with exclusive nationwide jurisdiction over civil actions against the

United States, its agencies and officers. Its jurisdiction also includes
certain civil actions brought by the United States, arising out of import
transactions and the administration and enforcement of the federal customs
and international trade laws. The Court reviews administrative decisions of
the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection involving the tariff laws of
the United States, including the classification and valuation of imported
merchandise. The Court hears judicial challenges to determinations

by the United States Department of Commerce and the United States
International Trade Commission pertaining to the antidumping and
countervailing duty laws. In addition, the Court reviews decisions by

the Secretary of Labor, Commerce or Agriculture certifying workers,
businesses or agricultural commodity procedures respectively eligible for
assistance due to economic injury caused by import competition. The
Court also possesses exclusive jurisdiction of actions brought by the
United States to: {1} recover civil penalties for fraud, gross negligence or
negligence in the entry of imported merchandise; (2) recover upon a bond
relating to the importation of merchandise; or (3) recover customs duties.
Judges are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. These
are Article III judgeships to which members are appointed for life, pending
good behavior. Cases are determined by a single judge. Cases raising a
constitutional issue or cases with broad significant implications may be
assigned by the chief judge to a three-judge panel: Appeals from the
Court of International Trade are heard by the United States Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Court is located in New York City,
but sessions may be held anywhere within the United States. The Court is
also authorized to hold hearings in foreign countries.

The Judicial Conference of the United States is the principal policy
making body concerned with the administration of the United States
Courts. The specific duties of the Judicial Conference include surveying
the conditions of business in the courts of the United States, preparing
plans for the assignment of judges to or from courts of appeals or district
courts, promoting uniformity of management procedures and the
expeditious conduct of court business, the reviewing of circuit council
conduct and disability orders, and carrying on a continuous study of the
operation and effect of general rules of practice and procedure in use
within the federal courts. In addition, the Judicial Conference supervises
the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts and
operates through a network of committees created to address and advise on
a variety of subjects dealing with administration of the courts. The Chief
Justice of the United States is the presiding officer of the conference.
Membership is comprised of the chief judges of each judicial circuit, the
chief judge of the Court of International Trade, and a district judge

from each regional judicial circuit. A circuit chief judge’s term on the
conference is concurrent with his or her term as chief Judge of the circuit,
seven years or until seventy years of age, whichever comes first. District
judge representatives are elected for terms of not less than three nor more
than five successive years, as established by majority vote of all circuit and
district judges of their circuit. Terms on the conference of elected members
are effective and expire on October 1 of any given year. The Director of
the Administrative Office of the United States Courts serves as the Judicial
Conference Secretary.
